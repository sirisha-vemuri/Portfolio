&lt;p&gt;Grouptag is a platform for professional networking for young professionals, particularly Gen Z.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an existing app, that has four different tabs, ‘Network’, ‘Channels’, ‘Discover’, and ‘Profile’, which include the features such as viewing connections, creating new ideas on the topics of interest of a user, waving at someone, viewing messages, viewing people based on the same interests, checking notifications and sharing the app with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This design is only limited to the user through an app. Grouptag wanted to get ‘new ideas’ for Gen Z in the creation of new ideas for a website. As there is no website designed for the users at present, I started off my Research by doing competitive analysis, generated new ideas by interacting with the users, and designed them accordingly. Below are the High Definition frames for the same:&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Grouptag is a platform for professional networking for young professionals, particularly Gen Z.There is an existing app, that has four different tabs, ‘Network’, ‘Channels’, ‘Discover’, and ‘Profile’, which include the features such as viewing connections, creating new ideas on the topics of interest of a user, waving at someone, viewing messages, viewing people based on the same interests, checking notifications and sharing the app with someone.This design is only limited to the user through an app. Grouptag wanted to get ‘new ideas’ for Gen Z in the creation of new ideas for a website. As there is no website designed for the users at present, I started off my Research by doing competitive analysis, generated new ideas by interacting with the users, and designed them accordingly.

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ling is a combined Chinese and Western Medicine practitioner with a PHD in Chinese Medicine and a Master of Reproductive Health. He and his practitioners provide acupuncture treatment that, when used with Western Medicine, can significantly improve the number of live births for woman undergoing IVF. &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; He wishes to expand awareness of acupuncture as a treatment and integrate acupuncture into treatment plans for patients with conditions such as infertility.

    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this document is to educate women on their health and wellbeing and conceiving naturally before jumping into invasive fertility treatments. Also to understand the mindsets of (a)women who receive acupuncture regularly, (b)women who may be interested but have not made the decision to receive acupuncture as a treatment, (c) women who manage stress during the pregnancy journey and treatment process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A woman who feels confused and stressed about her struggle of becoming pregnant wants to learn about what steps she should take to conceive and how she can get pregnant but faces a lack of educational resources. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My team members and I found it very important to understand the space of infertility as well. So, we conducted some desktop research in order to paint an overall picture of the problem space. We found that&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Infertility affects one in six Australian couples of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 40% of couples the cause of infertility is attributed to a sperm factor, in another 40% the cause is found within the female reproductive system, and a third will have a combination of male and female factors.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/desktopresearch1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/desktopresearch2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id=&quot;quantitative3&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane fade in&quot;&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The purpose of this survey was to collect some demographic information about women who are trying to conceive. We also wanted to measure attitudes and awareness towards the availability of information and educational resources when it comes to conceiving naturally. We also wanted to know whether women were aware that acupuncture and Chinese medicine can treat fertility. &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;So in total, we received 19 responses from the survey. 47% of them felt that they did not get enough education on how to conceive naturally. &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;Two of the women in the survey were either planning on doing IVF or were in the process of doing IVF and they both agreed that they have not been given enough information on lifestyle changes they should adopt to increase the chances of IVF being successful. Also, two women who were trying to conceive responded to our questions about acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Out of them, one was not even aware that acupuncture is a fertility treatment and the other said that although she was aware that it is used as treatment, she does not plan on getting it as treatment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/surveydata.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id=&quot;qualitative3&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane fade in&quot;&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;In order to dig deeper, we conducted 7 user interviews. In all these interviews, women were in the process of actively trying to conceive except one who had recently had a baby, but she did go through the pregnancy and treatment journey not long before the interview. Five of these women were undergoing IVF, one had done IUI and one was in the process of finding out what fertility treatment to undertake. So, none of them were actively trying to conceive naturally and we were unable to look into this user group. However, we did interview 3 women who were actively undergoing acupuncture and taking Chinese medicine as part of their treatment, and we interviewed 4 women who have never had acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment. This did work in our favour because one of the objectives that came up in the initial briefing was to understand the mindsets of women who were not doing taking acupuncture and Chinese medicine as a form of treatment and we were able to understand why some women do not undergo acupuncture despite being aware of it as a form of fertility treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/oneononeinterview.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Using Research to create insights and understanding the pain points&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the Define phase, we took the research findings and began to study the data to draw out key insights&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;ol align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Users felt that acupuncture and Chinese medicine improved their fertility and other symptoms they were experiencing such as stress, lethargy, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who had never undergone acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment had heard about the treatment and were interested, but were indecisive because they did not have enough knowledge about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest pain points, experienced by all women whether or not they were undergoing acupuncture and Chinese medicine, was the stress associated with trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We also found that women who were receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine started later in their pregnancy journey after failed rounds of IUI or IVF because they were finding out about it much later through word of mouth. We also found that women who were not receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine were not doing so because they did not know enough about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found that women were finding out about it so late or not finding out about it at all because it is never recommended by the health professionals they come into contact with during their pregnancy journey like their GP.&lt;/p&gt;

      From the gynaecologists, we learned that health practitioners do not take the time to really educate their patients. They’re more focussed on referring their patients to the next specialist. She said that if she could have things her way to make the process less stressful and more informative for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      Previously, the key research insights are in the form of How Might We questions and we were asked by the client to focus on the following:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can we get Anna and Alice to view acupuncture and Chinese medicine as an effective fertility treatment (with or without IVF) at the beginning of their treatment process, rather than as a result of failed IVF attempts and as an act of desperation?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This HMW question was chosen because the client rightly pointed out that women deserve to be aware that acupuncture is an effective treatment that facilitates conceiving naturally early on in their pregnancy journey before going through multiple failed rounds of IVF and financial loss.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/hmw4.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Develop effective solutions which address the pain points using an iterative approach&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We conducted an extensive competitive analysis to find out how other fertility organisations educate users on fertility and treatment. We looked at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of organisations such as Kinn fertility, Monash IVF, Melbourne IVF, and more which you can later have a look at. This analysis provided us with some ideas for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/competitiveanalysis.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since our solution needed to increase infertility awareness and education, we also looked at other industries which seek to spread awareness and education regarding a sensitive issue. For instance, we found that Beyond Blue, an Australian mental health and wellbeing organisation, provides guidance on what steps to take to reach out for mental health support in difficult times. By looking into how other industries increase awareness, we came up with some ideas for our own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/otherindustries.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Following the competitive analysis, we conducted a workshop with our own team because by this time in the project, all of our team members had done extensive research into the field of fertility and acupuncture and were practicing empathy to a great extent towards the users. This allowed us to come up with solutions to their problems through brainwriting activities such as crazy 4s and mashups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also conducted a user workshop with two women who received fertility treatment and they came up with some great ideas as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/userworkshop.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We then presented the ideas generated from the workshops and competitive analysis to the client who voted on top solutions. The solution features were then mapped onto a minimum viable product matrix to find out the most feasible, viable, and desirable outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The MVP turned out to be educational sample journey, which informs women what treatment and lifestyle changes are important to adopt in each stage of the ovulation cycle in order to improve fertility. The journey also outlines how Sustain Health will help the user incorporate these treatments and lifestyle changes into their treatment journey. This tool will also have information on the cost of acupuncture and Chinese medicine compared to other fertility treatments. Other educational features will also be included such as professional articles. These features are intended to be additions to the Sustain Health website.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;em&gt;Build and test the solution&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We conducted some concept testing with two users who had the same story as our persona, Alice. This involved showing our sketches of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We heard the users say things like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I think it’s good if you want to research about fertility and treatment, this is great because everything is on one page.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/userflow.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/userflow1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We then designed a Mid-fi prototype of the Sustain Health website with the solution incorporated. The Key features of the solution include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/medfi1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An educational video clip in which Dr Scott Ling explains how acupuncture and Chinese medicine treat fertility&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/medfi2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also created an interactive figure based on our own research and insights from our interviews with acupuncture specialists, which attracts users to learn in a fun way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did learn that different practitioners of acupuncture have different approaches to treating the same conditions so the above interactive figure is not suggesting exactly how acupuncture works, but is just an idea for how Dr Scott Ling might educate his patients in a fun way.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/medfi3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also created a sample journey which outlines information on what to expect at each stage of the pregnancy journey, what treatment is necessary to allow for natural conception to occur, and how Sustain Health will deliver these treatments. For instance, it explains how acupuncture will prepare the body for fertilisation prior to ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/samplejourney.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also took into consideration Alice’s financial stress regarding acupuncture and gave an estimated price comparison between acupuncture and other fertility treatments such as IVF.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/cost.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have also provided an “Our Team” section which provides information on professionals at Sustain Health and people’s reviews of their services.The review section is important. The review of the doctor can be the reference for potential customers. By building trust from reviews, people may be encouraged to book a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/ourteam.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the FAQs part, we have a chat box as well, we have provided customer support as live chat, so people can inquire if they still have questions.This allows them to ask questions on the spot which can receive quicker answers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/faqs.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The final part consists of educational and professional articles to give Alice and Anna a deeper understanding of how acupuncture and Chinese medicine successfully work as well as advice that addresses many issues that they may face on their pregnancy journey.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/profarticles.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We invited 5 users for our Mid-Fi wireframe test who had the same stories as our personas Alice and Anna. We got some great comments and improvement suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Usability Testing&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We made lots of changes based on the user’s feedback during the usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two out of five users thought that the categories menu was not interactive and users kept ignoring it when visiting the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three out of five users felt that the interactive figure was not providing enough information on how acupuncture works on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Sample Journey, two out of five users said that the lifestyle advice was too vague and repetitive. Also, some users found it difficult to access reviews in the sample journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the cost comparison, we found that four out of five users did not understand the first page and found the flow too long and complex and two out of five users struggled to understand what IVF and IUI were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, we addressed all of these issues in the high fidelity wireframes, With the categories we combined pictures and words to make the categories more identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/updatedprototype1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/updatedprototype4.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the client suggested, we have also added one more part to the website which is the case study conducted by Academy Xi students. This case study shares the stories of women whose lives were changed with acupuncture and Chinese medicine as it improved their fertility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/sustainhealth/casestudy.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;NEXT STEPS&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We recommend the next steps for this project to be: Further user testing for the high fidelity prototype. Users also liked the idea of a personalised pregnancy journey diary, so that could also be added and user tested. Also to come up with a marketing strategy that will attract users to the Sustain Health website.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;

        <summary type="html">Dr. Ling is a combined Chinese and Western Medicine practitioner with a PHD in Chinese Medicine and a Master of Reproductive Health. He and his practitioners provide acupuncture treatment that, when used with Western Medicine, can significantly improve the number of live births for woman undergoing IVF. He wishes to expand awareness of acupuncture as a treatment and integrate acupuncture into treatment plans for patients with conditions such as infertility. Click through the tabs below to see the details of each phase. Discover Define Develop Deliver Understanding the problem space Client Brief The purpose of this document is to educate women on their health and wellbeing and conceiving naturally before jumping into invasive fertility treatments. Also to understand the mindsets of (a)women who receive acupuncture regularly, (b)women who may be interested but have not made the decision to receive acupuncture as a treatment, (c) women who manage stress during the pregnancy journey and treatment process. Project Scope Initial Problem Statement A woman who feels confused and stressed about her struggle of becoming pregnant wants to learn about what steps she should take to conceive and how she can get pregnant but faces a lack of educational resources. Desktop Research Quantitative Qualitative My team members and I found it very important to understand the space of infertility as well. So, we conducted some desktop research in order to paint an overall picture of the problem space. We found that Infertility affects one in six Australian couples of reproductive age. In 40% of couples the cause of infertility is attributed to a sperm factor, in another 40% the cause is found within the female reproductive system, and a third will have a combination of male and female factors. The purpose of this survey was to collect some demographic information about women who are trying to conceive. We also wanted to measure attitudes and awareness towards the availability of information and educational resources when it comes to conceiving naturally. We also wanted to know whether women were aware that acupuncture and Chinese medicine can treat fertility. So in total, we received 19 responses from the survey. 47% of them felt that they did not get enough education on how to conceive naturally. Two of the women in the survey were either planning on doing IVF or were in the process of doing IVF and they both agreed that they have not been given enough information on lifestyle changes they should adopt to increase the chances of IVF being successful. Also, two women who were trying to conceive responded to our questions about acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Out of them, one was not even aware that acupuncture is a fertility treatment and the other said that although she was aware that it is used as treatment, she does not plan on getting it as treatment. In order to dig deeper, we conducted 7 user interviews. In all these interviews, women were in the process of actively trying to conceive except one who had recently had a baby, but she did go through the pregnancy and treatment journey not long before the interview. Five of these women were undergoing IVF, one had done IUI and one was in the process of finding out what fertility treatment to undertake. So, none of them were actively trying to conceive naturally and we were unable to look into this user group. However, we did interview 3 women who were actively undergoing acupuncture and taking Chinese medicine as part of their treatment, and we interviewed 4 women who have never had acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment. This did work in our favour because one of the objectives that came up in the initial briefing was to understand the mindsets of women who were not doing taking acupuncture and Chinese medicine as a form of treatment and we were able to understand why some women do not undergo acupuncture despite being aware of it as a form of fertility treatment. Using Research to create insights and understanding the pain points In the Define phase, we took the research findings and began to study the data to draw out key insights Users felt that acupuncture and Chinese medicine improved their fertility and other symptoms they were experiencing such as stress, lethargy, and insomnia. Users who had never undergone acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment had heard about the treatment and were interested, but were indecisive because they did not have enough knowledge about it. One of the biggest pain points, experienced by all women whether or not they were undergoing acupuncture and Chinese medicine, was the stress associated with trying to conceive. We also found that women who were receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine started later in their pregnancy journey after failed rounds of IUI or IVF because they were finding out about it much later through word of mouth. We also found that women who were not receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine were not doing so because they did not know enough about it. We found that women were finding out about it so late or not finding out about it at all because it is never recommended by the health professionals they come into contact with during their pregnancy journey like their GP. From the gynaecologists, we learned that health practitioners do not take the time to really educate their patients. They’re more focussed on referring their patients to the next specialist. She said that if she could have things her way to make the process less stressful and more informative for the patient. Previously, the key research insights are in the form of How Might We questions and we were asked by the client to focus on the following: How can we get Anna and Alice to view acupuncture and Chinese medicine as an effective fertility treatment (with or without IVF) at the beginning of their treatment process, rather than as a result of failed IVF attempts and as an act of desperation? This HMW question was chosen because the client rightly pointed out that women deserve to be aware that acupuncture is an effective treatment that facilitates conceiving naturally early on in their pregnancy journey before going through multiple failed rounds of IVF and financial loss. Develop effective solutions which address the pain points using an iterative approach We conducted an extensive competitive analysis to find out how other fertility organisations educate users on fertility and treatment. We looked at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of organisations such as Kinn fertility, Monash IVF, Melbourne IVF, and more which you can later have a look at. This analysis provided us with some ideas for a solution. Since our solution needed to increase infertility awareness and education, we also looked at other industries which seek to spread awareness and education regarding a sensitive issue. For instance, we found that Beyond Blue, an Australian mental health and wellbeing organisation, provides guidance on what steps to take to reach out for mental health support in difficult times. By looking into how other industries increase awareness, we came up with some ideas for our own solution.

&lt;p&gt;Milestone Pay started as an idea to help freelancers and small businesses ensure they get paid for the hard work that they do. &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt; Three years ago, MilestonePay started with a contract builder that had payments, dispute resolution and deliverables built in to boost the communication between clients and service providers. They quickly realised that in addition to this, businesses needed more support and were generally overwhelmed by the amount of “busy” work that was involved with the administration side of the business. &lt;br /&gt;

         &lt;b&gt;Client Brief&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project is to build a tool to help our users (Freelancers and Small Business Owners) create a workflow for their customers to seamlessly automate their interactions, increase customer communication and satisfaction by reducing back of house operations (Invoicing, Document generation, Project management, etc.) and systemize their business in a quick and easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;b&gt;Initial Problem Statement&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Freelancers who feel unmotivated and overwhelmed about the admin process of running a small business - need to seamlessly onboard, service and invoice their clients, but don&apos;t have a lot of time and don&apos;t know where to begin&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;ul class=&quot;nav nav-tabs nav-justified&quot;&gt;
         &lt;li class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a data-toggle=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#desktopresearch2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;u&gt;Desktop Research&lt;/u&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a data-toggle=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#quantitative2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;u&gt;Quantitative&lt;/u&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a data-toggle=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#qualitative2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;u&gt;Qualitative&lt;/u&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;tab-content&quot;&gt;
         &lt;div id=&quot;desktopresearch2&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane fade in active&quot;&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We then started with Desktop Research to understand the users, and we learned that there are roughly 4.1million freelancers in Australia of whom 40% reported feeling time-poor. 31% also said they would like to learn about how to automate their business.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/desktopresearch.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So if they aren&apos;t using MilestonePay already, what kind of tools are they using?
               &lt;br /&gt;
               We did some competitor analysis to understand the landscape and performed a SWOT analysis on 4 of the top competitors that you can look through later.
               &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
               They are as below:
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/competitoranalysis.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/research1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/research2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/research3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/research4.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/research5.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We considered MilestonePay&apos;s value proposition, asking: what makes it stand out against its competitors, and what do the users value about it? 
               &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
               Its present values are that it&apos;s an Australian Platform and has a free tier, making it feel more accessible and it is built for the humble freelancer rather than large corporations. The Milestone Pay option also helps users get paid with less friction.
               &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
               We also looked at how Milestone would stand out in the future, with a more user-friendly platform and substantial level of automation.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We received 26 responses across 2 surveys. Questions ranged from the &quot;tell us about your business development process&quot; to &quot;how do you manage scope creep&quot;, &quot;have you ever had trouble getting paid&quot; and &quot;do you regularly ask for feedback&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;We held 14 one-on-one interviews with 8 freelancers and 6 clients from professions - Front End Web Developer, Photographer, Business Coach, Project Manager, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

         &lt;em&gt;Using Research to create insights and understanding the pain points&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the Define phase, we took the research findings and began to study the data to draw out key insights&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/quotes.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We heard about their experience with contracts and proposals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/contracts.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also heard about their struggles and experience with invoicing and Payments&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/invoices.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We learned that most of them rarely ask for structured feedback at the end&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/feedback.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;h4&gt;
         &lt;b&gt;KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS:&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We surveyed 26 small business owners and held 1:1 interviews with 10 freelancers and 6 clients. We synthesised their thoughts, feelings, statements, and actions and distilled the findings down into a series of key insights&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General:&lt;/strong&gt; Their system for managing business is working fine, but most of them are more in reactive/survival mode vs a thriving/proactive mode.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Their existing tools are spread between multiple platforms and software. Many said they would like to leverage an all-in-one platform, but hesitate because they are costly and primarily US centric.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templates:&lt;/strong&gt; Most freelancers have their own templates for proposals, quotes, contracts &amp;amp; invoices that they either created themselves, found online or gathered from friends in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Leads, Proposals &amp;amp; Quoting:&lt;/strong&gt;Most of the freelancers are lucky to have a base of repeat clients or get new work through word of mouth or social media (LinkedIn, FB, IG), however, many struggle with their skills in online marketing and bringing in new business. Few reported having a system for CRM management.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contracts &amp;amp; Supplier Onboarding:&lt;/strong&gt; Most freelancers lack confidence when it comes to contracts and the other legal aspects of running a business.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering the Work: &lt;/strong&gt; Many reported struggles with collecting payment from their clients at least once due to misaligned expectations. The most common best practice advice we heard was &quot;Communication is key&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invoicing &amp;amp; Payment: &lt;/strong&gt; The biggest frustrations we heard from Clients had to do with supplier documentation not meeting their requirements for auditing&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Management &amp;amp; Taxes:&lt;/strong&gt; Many freelancers reported struggles with keeping up with their taxes, budgeting and other business management tasks like managing their pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback &amp;amp; Repeat Business:&lt;/strong&gt; Only about 40% said they regularly ask for client feedback after they complete a job.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Clarissa represents the freelancer archetype and is based on a summary of our key findings across the surveys and freelancer interviews. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/personafreelancer.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We mapped Clarissa&apos;s journey through a typical project, using actual quotes from our many interviews and surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/freelanceruserjourney.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also developed a persona for our Client archetype - Vicky.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/personaclient.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We mapped a complementary journey for Vicky to represent the same project experience, but from the client point of view, so that we could help Clarissa with her goal of appearing more professional to her clients.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/clientuserjourney.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We looked back at all the key findings and revisited our Problem Statement to see if we were still on the right track. &lt;br /&gt; We observed that our original hypothesis was a little off.  Freelancers were not feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed, but rather they felt unsure and disorganised. &lt;br /&gt;And their needs were less about seamlessly onboarding, servicing and invoicing clients, and more about the need to run a professional looking business, but lacked time and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;
         &lt;b&gt;Pivoted problem Statement:&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Freelancers who feel unsure and disorganised about running a professional business need to stay on top of their tasks but face a lack of time and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;

         &lt;em&gt;Develop effective solutions which address the pain points using an iterative approach&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/howmightwe.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We ran 3 workshops with 15 participants including freelancers, sole business owners, and classmates. As per the brief, our goal was to generate as many ideas as possible. Participants were encouraged to be as outrageous as they liked and to value quantity over quality, as all ideas can be later refined.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/workshop1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/workshop2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/workshoptechniques.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/ideaworkshop.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After the workshops we found similarities between some of the participants&apos; ideas which we considered as possible solutions. &lt;br /&gt;For some of the more creative ideas, we went back to our freelancers and asked them to rate them on a five point scale to validate their usefulness.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/freelancervoting.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;12 of these ideas were rated a 4 or more out of 5, and identified as the most helpful. &lt;br /&gt;This included features such as an Invoice Pie Chart that automatically displays take home pay, taxes and super based on incoming invoices. &lt;br /&gt; As well as Check and Tick -  a digital brief that is presented with a checkbox next to each deliverable to ensure both parties understand and agree to each item.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/concepttesting.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We looked at what could realistically be implemented and highlighted those ideas. Those that were too expensive, too complicated, or not worth the time, were discarded.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/mvp.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/ideas1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/ideas2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/ideas3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;img src=&quot;./img/milestonePay/focus.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From here, we developed the user flow for both the Proposals Studio and Contracts Helper, to show how our freelancers could navigate through these two tools, which were very closely linked together.

      &lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After Sketching, we translated these into wireframes on Figma to show the basic building blocks of these features and set us up for Prototyping and Testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We needed to find an efficient process for creating proposals for new projects for Clarissa(Persona).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In response to her pain points, we developed a Lo Fi prototype for the Proposal studio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Proposal Studio is comprised of a conversation-style form that prompts the user with a series of questions, tooltips, and recommendations, to guide both newbies and seasoned professionals alike through the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Tool consists of the below information:
      &lt;ol align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A list of projects she previously set up in CRM. By selecting a project from the drop-down, most of the important information is auto-populated into the forms, saving Clarissa`s time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She also has the option to add a new project that will backfill data into the CRM, if she prefers to start with this step first&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tool has a range of pre filled templates for common scopes of service&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Starts off with the main proposal page which lists the projects she had done.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;She can add a new project from here and this will take her through the process of filling out a proposal e.g. adding client information, deliverables, schedules etc...&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      Clarrissa also lacked confidence when it came to writing up contracts for her clients. So we created  contract helper to take the stress out of writing a scope of work.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Similar to the proposal studio, Contract Helper is comprised of a conversation style form that helps the user build their contract live in the preview zone, by answering a series of simple questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features include:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;tool tips that guide her through the process and automation between the Proposals Studio and Contract Helper, to prevent her from having to enter the same data twice&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A step by step guide for crafting the legal project description and contracting entities&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;short definitions to guide the Clarissa through with common tricky topics like Limitation of Liability, Intellectual Property and Indemnity&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, she has the option to share the contract with one of her colleagues for review before issuing the document to the Client&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

        <summary type="html">Milestone Pay started as an idea to help freelancers and small businesses ensure they get paid for the hard work that they do. Three years ago, MilestonePay started with a contract builder that had payments, dispute resolution and deliverables built in to boost the communication between clients and service providers. They quickly realised that in addition to this, businesses needed more support and were generally overwhelmed by the amount of “busy” work that was involved with the administration side of the business. Click through the tabs below to see the details of each phase. Discover Define Develop Deliver Understanding the problem space Client Brief The purpose of this project is to build a tool to help our users (Freelancers and Small Business Owners) create a workflow for their customers to seamlessly automate their interactions, increase customer communication and satisfaction by reducing back of house operations (Invoicing, Document generation, Project management, etc.) and systemize their business in a quick and easy way. Project Scope Initial Problem Statement Freelancers who feel unmotivated and overwhelmed about the admin process of running a small business - need to seamlessly onboard, service and invoice their clients, but don&apos;t have a lot of time and don&apos;t know where to begin Desktop Research Quantitative Qualitative We then started with Desktop Research to understand the users, and we learned that there are roughly 4.1million freelancers in Australia of whom 40% reported feeling time-poor. 31% also said they would like to learn about how to automate their business. So if they aren&apos;t using MilestonePay already, what kind of tools are they using? We did some competitor analysis to understand the landscape and performed a SWOT analysis on 4 of the top competitors that you can look through later. They are as below: We considered MilestonePay&apos;s value proposition, asking: what makes it stand out against its competitors, and what do the users value about it? Its present values are that it&apos;s an Australian Platform and has a free tier, making it feel more accessible and it is built for the humble freelancer rather than large corporations. The Milestone Pay option also helps users get paid with less friction. We also looked at how Milestone would stand out in the future, with a more user-friendly platform and substantial level of automation. We received 26 responses across 2 surveys. Questions ranged from the &quot;tell us about your business development process&quot; to &quot;how do you manage scope creep&quot;, &quot;have you ever had trouble getting paid&quot; and &quot;do you regularly ask for feedback&quot;? We held 14 one-on-one interviews with 8 freelancers and 6 clients from professions - Front End Web Developer, Photographer, Business Coach, Project Manager, and more. Using Research to create insights and understanding the pain points In the Define phase, we took the research findings and began to study the data to draw out key insights We heard about their experience with contracts and proposals We also heard about their struggles and experience with invoicing and Payments We learned that most of them rarely ask for structured feedback at the end KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS: We surveyed 26 small business owners and held 1:1 interviews with 10 freelancers and 6 clients. We synthesised their thoughts, feelings, statements, and actions and distilled the findings down into a series of key insights General: Their system for managing business is working fine, but most of them are more in reactive/survival mode vs a thriving/proactive mode. Tools: Their existing tools are spread between multiple platforms and software. Many said they would like to leverage an all-in-one platform, but hesitate because they are costly and primarily US centric. Templates: Most freelancers have their own templates for proposals, quotes, contracts &amp;amp; invoices that they either created themselves, found online or gathered from friends in the industry. New Leads, Proposals &amp;amp; Quoting:Most of the freelancers are lucky to have a base of repeat clients or get new work through word of mouth or social media (LinkedIn, FB, IG), however, many struggle with their skills in online marketing and bringing in new business. Few reported having a system for CRM management. Contracts &amp;amp; Supplier Onboarding: Most freelancers lack confidence when it comes to contracts and the other legal aspects of running a business. Delivering the Work: Many reported struggles with collecting payment from their clients at least once due to misaligned expectations. The most common best practice advice we heard was &quot;Communication is key&quot;. Invoicing &amp;amp; Payment: The biggest frustrations we heard from Clients had to do with supplier documentation not meeting their requirements for auditing Business Management &amp;amp; Taxes: Many freelancers reported struggles with keeping up with their taxes, budgeting and other business management tasks like managing their pipeline. Feedback &amp;amp; Repeat Business: Only about 40% said they regularly ask for client feedback after they complete a job. Clarissa represents the freelancer archetype and is based on a summary of our key findings across the surveys and freelancer interviews. We mapped Clarissa&apos;s journey through a typical project, using actual quotes from our many interviews and surveys. We also developed a persona for our Client archetype - Vicky. We mapped a complementary journey for Vicky to represent the same project experience, but from the client point of view, so that we could help Clarissa with her goal of appearing more professional to her clients. We looked back at all the key findings and revisited our Problem Statement to see if we were still on the right track. We observed that our original hypothesis was a little off. Freelancers were not feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed, but rather they felt unsure and disorganised. And their needs were less about seamlessly onboarding, servicing and invoicing clients, and more about the need to run a professional looking business, but lacked time and knowledge. Pivoted problem Statement: Freelancers who feel unsure and disorganised about running a professional business need to stay on top of their tasks but face a lack of time and knowledge. Develop effective solutions which address the pain points using an iterative approach We ran 3 workshops with 15 participants including freelancers, sole business owners, and classmates. As per the brief, our goal was to generate as many ideas as possible. Participants were encouraged to be as outrageous as they liked and to value quantity over quality, as all ideas can be later refined. After the workshops we found similarities between some of the participants&apos; ideas which we considered as possible solutions. For some of the more creative ideas, we went back to our freelancers and asked them to rate them on a five point scale to validate their usefulness. 12 of these ideas were rated a 4 or more out of 5, and identified as the most helpful. This included features such as an Invoice Pie Chart that automatically displays take home pay, taxes and super based on incoming invoices. As well as Check and Tick - a digital brief that is presented with a checkbox next to each deliverable to ensure both parties understand and agree to each item. We looked at what could realistically be implemented and highlighted those ideas. Those that were too expensive, too complicated, or not worth the time, were discarded. From here, we developed the user flow for both the Proposals Studio and Contracts Helper, to show how our freelancers could navigate through these two tools, which were very closely linked together. Build and test the solution Sketching wireframing After Sketching, we translated these into wireframes on Figma to show the basic building blocks of these features and set us up for Prototyping and Testing. We needed to find an efficient process for creating proposals for new projects for Clarissa(Persona). In response to her pain points, we developed a Lo Fi prototype for the Proposal studio. The Proposal Studio is comprised of a conversation-style form that prompts the user with a series of questions, tooltips, and recommendations, to guide both newbies and seasoned professionals alike through the process. Tool consists of the below information: A list of projects she previously set up in CRM. By selecting a project from the drop-down, most of the important information is auto-populated into the forms, saving Clarissa`s time. She also has the option to add a new project that will backfill data into the CRM, if she prefers to start with this step first The tool has a range of pre filled templates for common scopes of service Starts off with the main proposal page which lists the projects she had done. She can add a new project from here and this will take her through the process of filling out a proposal e.g. adding client information, deliverables, schedules etc... Clarrissa also lacked confidence when it came to writing up contracts for her clients. So we created contract helper to take the stress out of writing a scope of work. Similar to the proposal studio, Contract Helper is comprised of a conversation style form that helps the user build their contract live in the preview zone, by answering a series of simple questions. Features include: tool tips that guide her through the process and automation between the Proposals Studio and Contract Helper, to prevent her from having to enter the same data twice A step by step guide for crafting the legal project description and contracting entities short definitions to guide the Clarissa through with common tricky topics like Limitation of Liability, Intellectual Property and Indemnity Finally, she has the option to share the contract with one of her colleagues for review before issuing the document to the Client What did Clarissa`s say? Proposals:We asked about their experience with the Proposals Tool and we heard things like: &quot;It was easy to use, clear, simple&quot;, &quot;I like the idea. It&apos;s a good prompt to do it&quot; Contracts:we asked them about their experience with the contracts tool and we heard things like: &quot;It would be a good idea to have an example for the user&quot;&quot;Normally the contract I send to potential clients will provide a condition like It is only valid for 30 days, and beyond that date, it is subject to change.&quot;&quot;It would be great to have a couple more pages where all the data from the form comes over and is maybe editable. then if the client asks for changes you can easily update it&quot;</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One in three Australians have gained weight during the pandemic!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to know about this fact and wanted to do my research on the same as my Acadamic Project at Academy Xi. I used the &lt;strong&gt;Double Diamond&lt;/strong&gt; approach to obtain a solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;b&gt;Project Scoping&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to determine all the parameters; including any goals, assumptions, potential risks, and constraints, I have developed this project canvas at the start of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;b&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Covid has changed lives. &lt;br /&gt;Given the scenario that most of us were staying at home, we could not get enough exercise, some of us have put ona few extra kilos. This research is to understand how covid weight gain has affected one`s overall health, and the steps they are taking to get back to their previous &lt;strong&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;RESEARCH PLAN&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have chalked out a research plan, on how to solve the Problem Statement. Three types of research techniques were used. Click through the tabs below for more details about each of the research technique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I did google search on the topic “Covid Weight Gain” and found the below critical information:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One in three Australians have gained weight during the pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A new study by Australia&apos;s national science agency, CSIRO, has found that weight and emotional wellbeing has suffered throughout the COVID-19 lockdown, with Australians also feeling concerned about how long it will take for life to return to &quot;normal&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/obesity-research-and-clinical-practice/vol/14/issue/4&quot;&gt;An Aussie study&lt;/a&gt; looking at the impact of lockdown on at-home weight loss showed 60% of people surveyed believed their diet had been affected, and 52% said the same about their exercise routine.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below are some of the articles which I referred to:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a part of Research, I wanted to know what is the current trend on the topic “covid weight gain” and so analysed this information via &lt;strong&gt;Google Trends&lt;/strong&gt; and found out that the interest over time was increasing. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/googletrends.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id=&quot;quantitative1&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane fade&quot;&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There were 11 participants who took part in the survey. Below are the insights drawn:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;ol align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;72.7% of women were feeling low because of the weight gain&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the survey participants snack even if they are not hungry&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almost all the participants have gained weight&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly all the women who took part in the survey felt less confident about how they look and feel&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the women in their 30s said that losing weight is important to bring their confidence back&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the men were quite confident during the pandemic, even after gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Women in their 30s are most affected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Almost all of the participants have gained weight, but women had lost their confidence after gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, most of the men who have gained weight during the pandemic did not lose their confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some of the participants felt that exercising was ridiculous and needed motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They cancelled gym subscription as it was expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to have good mental health, and gain confidence back, participants wanted to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, lets have a look at Chloe&apos;s journey. &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Chloe was working from home for long hours and was followoing an improper diet, and so she gained weight. Chloe now decided to lose weight and tried to go to the gym. Chloe could not attend the gym during lockdown period. &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, she lost her job. She cancelled her gym membership as she couldnot afford it. She instead downloaded a calorie tracker app on her phone and lost some weight and is keen on losing a few extra kilos. &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;But, she found out that there were no exciting recipes listed in the app she was using, and also she needed motivation to do exercise and follow the workouts listed in the app in order to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4&gt;How Might we (HMW)&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After analyzing insights from the Research, I have carefully considered all of Chloe`s pain points and derived the below HMWs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HMW - help Chloe gain her confidence back?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HMW - help Chloe find online classes offered in her gym during the lockdown interesting and not to quit the gym instead?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HMW - help Chloe in letting her know about the exact number of calories used in her recipe, and also browse through some exciting recipes?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HMW - help Chloe to keep her motivated in continuing her exercise?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;IDEATION Workshops&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have conducted an Ideation workshop in Miro, always thinking about the problem statement and pain points of the persona &quot;Chloe&quot;. I used &lt;strong&gt;Crazy 8`s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Storyboard Brainstorming&lt;/strong&gt; techniques to help with the ideation and solutions. There were 4 Participants who helped Chloe obtain solution, which she would be happy with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crazy 8s Report&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/Crazy8s.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideation Workshop was fun . Below are some of the happy faces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt;
              &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/ideation1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt;
              &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/ideation2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt;
              &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/ideation3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt;
              &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/ideation4.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Storyboard and it&apos;s report&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/StoryboardChloe.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/StoryboardReport.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;h4&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Options from both top quadrants of the MVP were chosen to fulfil client brief and the desires of Chloe.
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/MVP.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    The solution was to have an all in one app, which would give Chloe an option to log calories, get a few motivational articles, get rewards for winning in challenges which she wishes to participate in. She can also invite her friends to this app to have an offline conversation about what she has won. Also, she would be getting notifications about articles related to workouts, healthy food habits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;h4&gt;User Flows&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below User Flows have been designed, keeping in view of the solution of an app, proposed in the MVP for Chloe.
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/UserFlows.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;Deliver1&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane fade&quot;&gt;
     &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Build and test the solution&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Low Fidelity wireframes&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As there were to many User flows, I chose to start my sketching in pen and paper. This really helped me in identifying key components in the fitness app for Chloe.
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/LowFidelity.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Medium Fidelity Wireframes&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/Medium1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/Medium2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./img/FitnessMe/Medium3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;hr style=&quot;border-top-color:#8d579c;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;High Fidelity Wireframes&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tested the High Fidelity Wireframes, twice, with 4 Chloes. This is the document that I used to plan my tests and the set of tasks I had them complete. One of the Chloe also tested the app on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The overall feedback was positive, with Chloes stating that they would download this app to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chloes loved the &quot;Rewards&quot; in the app when she gets an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chloes felt that the app was quite motivating, which is the primary pain point for Chloe.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback from User Testing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Change of some colors&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Change of the size of icons&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Inclusion of a Back button in one screen&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following are some of the next steps for this project:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Further development into the High fidelity application.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To know  how are the Chloe`s using the app, when it is live.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Possibility of creating more personas with further research.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
