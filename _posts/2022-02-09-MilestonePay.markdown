<br>
<p>Milestone Pay started as an idea to help freelancers and small businesses ensure they get paid for the hard work that they do. <br>
   <br> Three years ago, MilestonePay started with a contract builder that had payments, dispute resolution and deliverables built in to boost the communication between clients and service providers. They quickly realised that in addition to this, businesses needed more support and were generally overwhelmed by the amount of “busy” work that was involved with the administration side of the business. <br>

      <p>The purpose of this project is to build a tool to help our users (Freelancers and Small Business Owners) create a workflow for their customers to seamlessly automate their interactions, increase customer communication and satisfaction by reducing back of house operations (Invoicing, Document generation, Project management, etc.) and systemize their business in a quick and easy way.</p>

      <p>Freelancers who feel unmotivated and overwhelmed about the admin process of running a small business - need to seamlessly onboard, service and invoice their clients, but don't have a lot of time and don't know where to begin</p>

            <p>We then started with Desktop Research to understand the users, and we learned that there are roughly 4.1million freelancers in Australia of whom 40% reported feeling time-poor. 31% also said they would like to learn about how to automate their business.</p>

               <br>
               We did some competitor analysis to understand the landscape and performed a SWOT analysis on 4 of the top competitors that you can look through later.
               <br><br>
               They are as below:

            <br>
            <p>We considered MilestonePay's value proposition, asking: what makes it stand out against its competitors, and what do the users value about it? 
               <br><br>
               Its present values are that it's an Australian Platform and has a free tier, making it feel more accessible and it is built for the humble freelancer rather than large corporations. The Milestone Pay option also helps users get paid with less friction.
               <br><br>
               We also looked at how Milestone would stand out in the future, with a more user-friendly platform and substantial level of automation.

      <h4>
         <b>KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS:</b>
      </h4>
      <p>We surveyed 26 small business owners and held 1:1 interviews with 10 freelancers and 6 clients. We synthesised their thoughts, feelings, statements, and actions and distilled the findings down into a series of key insights</p>
      <br>
      <ul align="left">
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>General:</strong> Their system for managing business is working fine, but most of them are more in reactive/survival mode vs a thriving/proactive mode.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Their existing tools are spread between multiple platforms and software. Many said they would like to leverage an all-in-one platform, but hesitate because they are costly and primarily US centric.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Templates:</strong> Most freelancers have their own templates for proposals, quotes, contracts & invoices that they either created themselves, found online or gathered from friends in the industry.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>New Leads, Proposals & Quoting:</strong>Most of the freelancers are lucky to have a base of repeat clients or get new work through word of mouth or social media (LinkedIn, FB, IG), however, many struggle with their skills in online marketing and bringing in new business. Few reported having a system for CRM management.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Contracts & Supplier Onboarding:</strong> Most freelancers lack confidence when it comes to contracts and the other legal aspects of running a business.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Delivering the Work: </strong> Many reported struggles with collecting payment from their clients at least once due to misaligned expectations. The most common best practice advice we heard was "Communication is key".</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Invoicing & Payment: </strong> The biggest frustrations we heard from Clients had to do with supplier documentation not meeting their requirements for auditing</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Business Management & Taxes:</strong> Many freelancers reported struggles with keeping up with their taxes, budgeting and other business management tasks like managing their pipeline.</p>
         </li>
         <li align="left">
            <p><strong>Feedback & Repeat Business:</strong> Only about 40% said they regularly ask for client feedback after they complete a job.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Clarissa represents the freelancer archetype and is based on a summary of our key findings across the surveys and freelancer interviews. </p>

      <img src="./img/milestonePay/personafreelancer.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">

      <p>We mapped Clarissa's journey through a typical project, using actual quotes from our many interviews and surveys.</p>

      <img src="./img/milestonePay/freelanceruserjourney.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">

      <img src="./img/milestonePay/personaclient.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <br>
      <p>We mapped a complementary journey for Vicky to represent the same project experience, but from the client point of view, so that we could help Clarissa with her goal of appearing more professional to her clients.</p>

      <br>
      <p>We looked back at all the key findings and revisited our Problem Statement to see if we were still on the right track. <br> We observed that our original hypothesis was a little off.  Freelancers were not feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed, but rather they felt unsure and disorganised. <br>And their needs were less about seamlessly onboarding, servicing and invoicing clients, and more about the need to run a professional looking business, but lacked time and knowledge.</p>

      <p>We ran 3 workshops with 15 participants including freelancers, sole business owners, and classmates. As per the brief, our goal was to generate as many ideas as possible. Participants were encouraged to be as outrageous as they liked and to value quantity over quality, as all ideas can be later refined.</p>

      <img src="./img/milestonePay/ideaworkshop.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <br>
      <p>After the workshops we found similarities between some of the participants' ideas which we considered as possible solutions. <br>For some of the more creative ideas, we went back to our freelancers and asked them to rate them on a five point scale to validate their usefulness.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src="./img/milestonePay/freelancervoting.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <p>12 of these ideas were rated a 4 or more out of 5, and identified as the most helpful. <br>This included features such as an Invoice Pie Chart that automatically displays take home pay, taxes and super based on incoming invoices. <br> As well as Check and Tick -  a digital brief that is presented with a checkbox next to each deliverable to ensure both parties understand and agree to each item.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/milestonePay/concepttesting.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <p>We looked at what could realistically be implemented and highlighted those ideas. Those that were too expensive, too complicated, or not worth the time, were discarded.

      <p>We needed to find an efficient process for creating proposals for new projects for Clarissa(Persona).<br><br> In response to her pain points, we developed a Lo Fi prototype for the Proposal studio. <br><br> The Proposal Studio is comprised of a conversation-style form that prompts the user with a series of questions, tooltips, and recommendations, to guide both newbies and seasoned professionals alike through the process.<br><br>
      Tool consists of the below information:
      <ol align="left">
      <li>
      <p>A list of projects she previously set up in CRM. By selecting a project from the drop-down, most of the important information is auto-populated into the forms, saving Clarissa`s time.</p>

      <li>
      <p>She also has the option to add a new project that will backfill data into the CRM, if she prefers to start with this step first</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>The tool has a range of pre filled templates for common scopes of service</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Starts off with the main proposal page which lists the projects she had done.</li>
      <li>She can add a new project from here and this will take her through the process of filling out a proposal e.g. adding client information, deliverables, schedules etc...</li>

      Clarrissa also lacked confidence when it came to writing up contracts for her clients. So we created  contract helper to take the stress out of writing a scope of work.<br> <br>Similar to the proposal studio, Contract Helper is comprised of a conversation style form that helps the user build their contract live in the preview zone, by answering a series of simple questions. <br><br>Features include:</p>
      <ul align="left">
      <li>
      <p>tool tips that guide her through the process and automation between the Proposals Studio and Contract Helper, to prevent her from having to enter the same data twice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>A step by step guide for crafting the legal project description and contracting entities</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>short definitions to guide the Clarissa through with common tricky topics like Limitation of Liability, Intellectual Property and Indemnity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Finally, she has the option to share the contract with one of her colleagues for review before issuing the document to the Client</p>
