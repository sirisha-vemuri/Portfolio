  <b>Project 1</b>
  <br>
  <br> I worked on a project that manufactures fertiliser chemical explosives, and mining services. The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly shopping ordering experience through the organization`s website. In this project, I contributed my input in re-organising the existing design systems by grouping the figma frames into clusters, with dotted lines. <br><br>Firstly, I have taken a particular group of tickets and put them into boxes and colour-coded them into:
</p>
<ul align="left">
  <li align="left">
    <p>Yellow-In progress/Ready to review, </p>
  </li>
  <li align="left">
    <p>Green-Finalised designs after the design review meeting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>Then I grouped the existing design files into groups, and placed dotted lines around them, and named them according to the flow followed. <br>
  <br>This was easy for the developers and other new team members who joined the team to understand the flow easily, thus ensuring a high-quality deliverable for the client. <br>

  <br> In addition to the above, I also created user-flows, low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes for few of the tickets assigned to me.

  <b>Project 2</b>
  <br>
  <br> The next project which I worked on was for a corporation that deals with manufacturing building materials. The main objective of the project was to enhance and identify the gaps to ensure a good customer experience. <br><br>I have started my Research, to understand what did the tradies actually do on a day-to-day basis. As a part of my Research, I have used a few strategies like Desktop Research, Competitor analysis using the SWOT technique. <br><br>I have gathered inputs from the users and organised them into clusters. I have done Research Synthesis (affinity mapping) <br><br>I later worked on Service Blueprint. I started out by finding the best template to be used for the project, and then gathered information from the research, and then polished the blueprint to present it to the client. I have also contributed in the modification/adding any inputs to the personas created.<br><br>
