<p><i>One in three Australians have gained weight during the pandemic!</i></p>

<p>I was surprised to know about this fact and wanted to do my research on the same as my Acadamic Project at Academy Xi. I used the <strong>Double Diamond</strong> approach to obtain a solution for this.</p>

      <b>Project Scoping</b>

    <br>
    <p>In order to determine all the parameters; including any goals, assumptions, potential risks, and constraints, I have developed this project canvas at the start of the project.</p>

      <b>Problem Statement</b>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>Covid has changed lives. <br>Given the scenario that most of us were staying at home, we could not get enough exercise, some of us have put ona few extra kilos. This research is to understand how covid weight gain has affected one`s overall health, and the steps they are taking to get back to their previous <strong>"you"</strong>! </p>

    <h4>
      <b>RESEARCH PLAN</b>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>I have chalked out a research plan, on how to solve the Problem Statement. Three types of research techniques were used. Click through the tabs below for more details about each of the research technique.</p>

            <p>One in three Australians have gained weight during the pandemic</p>

          <li align="left">
            <p>A new study by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, has found that weight and emotional wellbeing has suffered throughout the COVID-19 lockdown, with Australians also feeling concerned about how long it will take for life to return to "normal".</p>

            <p>
              <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/obesity-research-and-clinical-practice/vol/14/issue/4">An Aussie study</a> looking at the impact of lockdown on at-home weight loss showed 60% of people surveyed believed their diet had been affected, and 52% said the same about their exercise routine.

    <p>Now, lets have a look at Chloe's journey. <br>
      <br>Chloe was working from home for long hours and was followoing an improper diet, and so she gained weight. Chloe now decided to lose weight and tried to go to the gym. Chloe could not attend the gym during lockdown period. <br>
      <br>In the meantime, she lost her job. She cancelled her gym membership as she couldnot afford it. She instead downloaded a calorie tracker app on her phone and lost some weight and is keen on losing a few extra kilos. <br>
      <br>But, she found out that there were no exciting recipes listed in the app she was using, and also she needed motivation to do exercise and follow the workouts listed in the app in order to lose weight.

    <p>I have conducted an Ideation workshop in Miro, always thinking about the problem statement and pain points of the persona "Chloe". I used <strong>Crazy 8`s</strong> and <strong>Storyboard Brainstorming</strong> techniques to help with the ideation and solutions. There were 4 Participants who helped Chloe obtain solution, which she would be happy with. <br><br><strong>Crazy 8s Report</strong> </p>

    <br>
    The solution was to have an all in one app, which would give Chloe an option to log calories, get a few motivational articles, get rewards for winning in challenges which she wishes to participate in. She can also invite her friends to this app to have an offline conversation about what she has won. Also, she would be getting notifications about articles related to workouts, healthy food habits.
