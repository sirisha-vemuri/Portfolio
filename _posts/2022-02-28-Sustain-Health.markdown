    <p>The purpose of this document is to educate women on their health and wellbeing and conceiving naturally before jumping into invasive fertility treatments. Also to understand the mindsets of (a)women who receive acupuncture regularly, (b)women who may be interested but have not made the decision to receive acupuncture as a treatment, (c) women who manage stress during the pregnancy journey and treatment process.</p>

    <br>
    <p>A woman who feels confused and stressed about her struggle of becoming pregnant wants to learn about what steps she should take to conceive and how she can get pregnant but faces a lack of educational resources. </p>

        <p>My team members and I found it very important to understand the space of infertility as well. So, we conducted some desktop research in order to paint an overall picture of the problem space. We found that</p>
        <ul align="left">
          <li>
            <p>Infertility affects one in six Australian couples of reproductive age.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In 40% of couples the cause of infertility is attributed to a sperm factor, in another 40% the cause is found within the female reproductive system, and a third will have a combination of male and female factors.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p> The purpose of this survey was to collect some demographic information about women who are trying to conceive. We also wanted to measure attitudes and awareness towards the availability of information and educational resources when it comes to conceiving naturally. We also wanted to know whether women were aware that acupuncture and Chinese medicine can treat fertility. <br>
          <br>So in total, we received 19 responses from the survey. 47% of them felt that they did not get enough education on how to conceive naturally. <br>
          <br>Two of the women in the survey were either planning on doing IVF or were in the process of doing IVF and they both agreed that they have not been given enough information on lifestyle changes they should adopt to increase the chances of IVF being successful. Also, two women who were trying to conceive responded to our questions about acupuncture and Chinese medicine. Out of them, one was not even aware that acupuncture is a fertility treatment and the other said that although she was aware that it is used as treatment, she does not plan on getting it as treatment.

      <br>
         <p>In order to dig deeper, we conducted 7 user interviews. In all these interviews, women were in the process of actively trying to conceive except one who had recently had a baby, but she did go through the pregnancy and treatment journey not long before the interview. Five of these women were undergoing IVF, one had done IUI and one was in the process of finding out what fertility treatment to undertake. So, none of them were actively trying to conceive naturally and we were unable to look into this user group. However, we did interview 3 women who were actively undergoing acupuncture and taking Chinese medicine as part of their treatment, and we interviewed 4 women who have never had acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment. This did work in our favour because one of the objectives that came up in the initial briefing was to understand the mindsets of women who were not doing taking acupuncture and Chinese medicine as a form of treatment and we were able to understand why some women do not undergo acupuncture despite being aware of it as a form of fertility treatment.</p>

         <em>Using Research to create insights and understanding the pain points</em>
      </p>
      <hr style="border-top-color:#8d579c;">
      <p>In the Define phase, we took the research findings and began to study the data to draw out key insights</p>
      <br>
      <ol align="left">
      <li>
      <p>Users felt that acupuncture and Chinese medicine improved their fertility and other symptoms they were experiencing such as stress, lethargy, and insomnia.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Users who had never undergone acupuncture and Chinese medicine as fertility treatment had heard about the treatment and were interested, but were indecisive because they did not have enough knowledge about it.</p></li>
      <li><p>One of the biggest pain points, experienced by all women whether or not they were undergoing acupuncture and Chinese medicine, was the stress associated with trying to conceive.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <img src="./img/sustainhealth/acupuncture2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <p>We also found that women who were receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine started later in their pregnancy journey after failed rounds of IUI or IVF because they were finding out about it much later through word of mouth. We also found that women who were not receiving acupuncture and Chinese medicine were not doing so because they did not know enough about it. <br><br>We found that women were finding out about it so late or not finding out about it at all because it is never recommended by the health professionals they come into contact with during their pregnancy journey like their GP.</p>

      From the gynaecologists, we learned that health practitioners do not take the time to really educate their patients. They’re more focussed on referring their patients to the next specialist. She said that if she could have things her way to make the process less stressful and more informative for the patient.</p>

      Previously, the key research insights are in the form of How Might We questions and we were asked by the client to focus on the following:<br> <br>How can we get Anna and Alice to view acupuncture and Chinese medicine as an effective fertility treatment (with or without IVF) at the beginning of their treatment process, rather than as a result of failed IVF attempts and as an act of desperation?<br> <br>This HMW question was chosen because the client rightly pointed out that women deserve to be aware that acupuncture is an effective treatment that facilitates conceiving naturally early on in their pregnancy journey before going through multiple failed rounds of IVF and financial loss.

      <p>We conducted an extensive competitive analysis to find out how other fertility organisations educate users on fertility and treatment. We looked at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of organisations such as Kinn fertility, Monash IVF, Melbourne IVF, and more which you can later have a look at. This analysis provided us with some ideas for a solution.</p>
      <img src="./img/sustainhealth/competitiveanalysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <br>
      <p>Since our solution needed to increase infertility awareness and education, we also looked at other industries which seek to spread awareness and education regarding a sensitive issue. For instance, we found that Beyond Blue, an Australian mental health and wellbeing organisation, provides guidance on what steps to take to reach out for mental health support in difficult times. By looking into how other industries increase awareness, we came up with some ideas for our own solution.</p>

      <img src="./img/sustainhealth/otherindustries.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <br>
      <p>Following the competitive analysis, we conducted a workshop with our own team because by this time in the project, all of our team members had done extensive research into the field of fertility and acupuncture and were practicing empathy to a great extent towards the users. This allowed us to come up with solutions to their problems through brainwriting activities such as crazy 4s and mashups.<br><br>We also conducted a user workshop with two women who received fertility treatment and they came up with some great ideas as well.</p>
      <img src="./img/sustainhealth/userworkshop.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" loading="lazy">
      <br>
      <p>We then presented the ideas generated from the workshops and competitive analysis to the client who voted on top solutions. The solution features were then mapped onto a minimum viable product matrix to find out the most feasible, viable, and desirable outcome.</p>

      <p>The MVP turned out to be educational sample journey, which informs women what treatment and lifestyle changes are important to adopt in each stage of the ovulation cycle in order to improve fertility. The journey also outlines how Sustain Health will help the user incorporate these treatments and lifestyle changes into their treatment journey. This tool will also have information on the cost of acupuncture and Chinese medicine compared to other fertility treatments. Other educational features will also be included such as professional articles. These features are intended to be additions to the Sustain Health website.</p>
